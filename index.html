                    <p>
                        I'm from Ukraine but currently living in Kitchener (ON, Canada) where I pursue my
                        programming education and career.

                    <p> 
                        My passion for coding started when I was in the middle school: I was into robotics
                        back then and I needed to write simple programs to make my Lego robots do what was intended. Since then I've
                        participated in multiple coding contests from school to national level working both solo and in teams of peers. I wanted
                        to take my programming career to a new level, so now I'm studying in the KW region that is famous for the variety of
                        startups born there and a great tech community.

                        Launch.io is a solution that our team came up with on the Space Apps Hackathon 2018. The app was made with Python, its
                        purpose is to make rocket launch information convinient and user friendly.
