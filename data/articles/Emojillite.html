    This time we came up with an interesting way of showing real-time satellite data. 
    Each satellite is represented as an emoji, the type of the emoji depends on the kind of data that satellite is collecting.
    For example, the METEOR PRIRODA satellite monitors atmospheric and sea-surface temperatures, so it is represented as a thermometer emoji.
