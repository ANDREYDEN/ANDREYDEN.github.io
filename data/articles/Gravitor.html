<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
    This was my first ever project made with <code>Unity</code>. I was doing contractor/freelancing work at the time and needed to learn
    <code>Unity</code> to develop a mobile application for <a href="https://maplemana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maple Mana</a>. 
    So I decided to make a simple platformer where you would control the character by changing the gravity. 
</p>
<h2>The Game</h2>
<p>
    You are an astronaut on a mission: collect valuable crystals and return to your spaceship. The only thing you were provided with
    is the gravitex - a special device that allows you to change gravity. 
    Jump between platforms, collect crystals and watch out for the void...
