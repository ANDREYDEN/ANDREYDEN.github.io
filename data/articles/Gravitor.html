    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        This was my first ever project made with <code>Unity</code>. I was doing contractor/freelancing work at the time and needed to learn
        <code>Unity</code> to develop a mobile application for <a href="https://maplemana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maple Mana</a>. 
        So I decided to make a simple platformer where you would control the character by changing the gravity.

    <h2>The Game</h2>
    <p>
        You are an astronaut on a mission: collect valuable crystals and return to your spaceship. The only thing you were provided with
        is the gravitex - a special device that allows you to change gravity. 
        Jump between platforms, collect crystals and watch out for the void...
    </p>
    <h2>What's inside?</h2>
    <p>
        It's all <code>Unity</code> and <code>C#</code> - tilemaps, game managers, rigid bodies, meshes and more.
