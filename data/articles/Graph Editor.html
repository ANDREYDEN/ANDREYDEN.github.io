    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        At high school I was taught a lot of back-end logic and algorithms (which, don't get me wrong, I appreciate and am grateful my teachers for).
        But there was always a desire not just to operate the numbers, but also to display the data in a meaningfull way. And it was not until 
        Grade 11 when I discovered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw" target="_blank">The Coding Train</a> - 
        a YouTube channel full of different interesting programming concepts and visualizations made by using this tool 
        called <a href="https://processing.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>Processing</code></a> 
        (later <a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">p5.js</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
        So when we had to do some visual programming at the end of high school I decided to create something using <code>Processing</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        All the functionality description as well as download instructions can be found on the 
        <a href="https://github.com/ANDREYDEN/GraphEditor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub page</a> of the project.
    </p>

    <h2>What's inside?</h2>
    <p><code>Java</code>, <code>Processing</code></p>
