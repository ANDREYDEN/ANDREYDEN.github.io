<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
    This is a landing page for the project that our team has been working on since we won the 
    <a href="http://blogs1.conestogac.on.ca/news/2019/03/student_projects_support_smart.php" target="_blank">Conestoga's 4x4 hackathon</a>
    in March 2019.
</p>

<p>
    The project has grown immensely and turned into one of Conestoga's 
    <a href="https://www.conestogac.on.ca/c4e/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Centre for Entrepreneurship</a> startups. 
    More information will be available soon and a prototype is to be released in the foreseeable future...
</p>

<p>
    This page in particular was built with <code>Vue</code> as there are multiple repeating components on the page 
    that might later be used in future web apps.
