<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
    This was my first ever hackathon experience and one of the most memorable ones. 
    Space Apps is a NASA and CSA sponsored annual hackathon held all over the globe. 
</p>
<p>
    My team and I had around 20 hours to develop an application that would show past and future rocket launches in different
    locations around the world. We decided to categorize the launches by place and time and show them on an interactive map
    with a 'cool' design.

<h2>Technical Details</h2>
<p>For this challenge we decided to use <code>Python</code>'s <code>Dash</code> library for web data visualization. 
    We didn't know the tool at the time so it was quite a challenge to learn it, as the library was pretty fresh 
    lacking documentation and active community. Now it is one of the go-to's for data visualization with <code>Python</code>
