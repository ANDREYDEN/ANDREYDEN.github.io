    <p>This was my first ever hackathon experience and one of the most memorable ones.</p>
    <p>My team and I had 20ish hours to develop an application that would show past and future rocket launches in
        different
        locations around the world. We decided to categorize the launches by place and time and show them on an
        interactive map
        with a 'cool' design.</p>
    <p>For this challenge we decided to use Python's Dash library for web data visualization. We didn't know the tool at
        the
        time so it was quite a challenge to learn it, as the library was pretty fresh lacking documentation and active
        community.</p>
