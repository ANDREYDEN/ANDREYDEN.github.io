    <h2>Hi!</h2>
    
    <p>I'm a full-stack software developer - always searching for new exciting projects to work on.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h2>Background</h2>
    
    <p>
        I've been creating these projects since high school and wrote my first game in <code>PascalABC</code> ... 
        It was Tic-Tac-Toe... 500 lines of code... I regret every single one of them...
    </p>
    <p>
        Since then I've tried various programming languages (<code>C++</code>, <code>Python</code>, 
        <code>JavaScript</code>, <code>C#</code>, <code>Java</code>) and successfully competed in multiple 
        coding challenges and Hackathons (Space Apps (2018, 2019), NSBEHacks, 4x4 Challenge, Hack the North, ETHWaterloo).
    </p>

    <h2>Backstory</h2>

    <p>
        It all started back in Kyiv, Ukraine, when I was first introduced to computer programming in 
        a seriese of LEGO workshops in Grade 5. This experience layed the foundation of my programming knowledge: creating 
        desicions, loops and handling robot's hardware input using a visual language similar to <code>Scratch</code>. In Grade 6 
        I was already competing in the Ukrainian LEGO Nationals.
    </p>
    <p>
        Following that, in high school I chose to focus my learning on the formal sciences and was rewarded. It was the time of the
        most mind changing experiences and explorations in the fields of mathematics, physics and computer science. Yeah, by the way,
        that Tic-Tac-Toe game was also created around the same time. After competing in various Olympiads and competitions it started
        to become more and more clear what I wanted to dedicate my time to.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        So here I am, working on the projects I like and seeking new challenges and new people to learn from.
        This website (being a little project on its own) contains some of the most exciting experiences
        I have had so far. I hope you'll find my work somewhat interesting as well!
