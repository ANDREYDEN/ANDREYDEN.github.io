    <h2>Hi!</h2>
    
    <p>I'm a software developer - enjoing life and working on projects I'm excited about.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h2>Background</h2>
    
    <p>I've started creating these projects since highschool writing my first game in <code>Pascal</code> ... 
    It was Tic-Tac-Toe... 500 lines of code... I regret every single one of them...</p>
    <p>Since then I've tried various programming languages (<code>C++</code>, <code>Python</code>, 
    <code>JavaScript</code>, <code>C#</code>, <code>Java</code>) 
    and competed in multiple coding challenges and Hackathons (Space Apps (2018, 2019), NSBEHacks, 4x4 Challenge, 
    Hack the North, ETHWaterloo).</p>

    <p>This website (being a little project itself) contains some of the most exciting experiences 
    I had so far in the world of software development. I hope you'll enjoy the journey as much as I did!</p>

    <h2>Backstory</h2>

    <p>I was born in Kyiv, Ukraine</p>
