                I started learning how to code in high school and wrote my first game in <code>PascalABC</code> 
                It was Tic-Tac-Toe... 500 lines of code... I regret every single one of them...
            </p>
            <p>
                Since then I've gained a lot experience and met some wonderful people who helped me along the way.

            <h3>Learning</h3>
            <p>
                <i>"The more you know, the more you realize you don't know."</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                Learning is a big part of my career. In this fast-paced tech industry, one can never stop seeking new opportunities 
                to enhance their toolset. In my opinion, one of the best ways to solidify what you've learned is to explain it to someone else. 
                That is why I always seek opportunities to share my knowledge by teaching and mentoring. You can never stop learning.
            </p>
            <h3>Change</h3>
            <p>
                I believe that change is what drives progress forward. I strive to be part of teams that welcome change, where 
                new ideas are respected and status quo is always challenged.
            </p>
            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>
                Throughout my career, I was involved in projects that required a lot of long-term planning and architecture while also 
                tackling problems on the fly. One time, I spent a week figuring out the math and planning the structure of a complex interactive 
                3D builder tool, and I loved it! Another time, I had to re-seed a database 10 minutes before an important demo, and I loved it just as much! 
                I'm thrilled by a non-trivial problem - that's what I like the most about what I do.

        <h2 slot="title">Backstory</h2>
        <div slot="content">
            <p>
                It all started back in Kyiv, Ukraine, when I was first introduced to computer programming in 
                a seriese of LEGO workshops in Grade 5. This experience layed the foundation of my programming knowledge: creating 
                desicions, loops and handling robot's hardware input using a visual language similar to <code>Scratch</code>. In Grade 6 
                I was already competing in the Ukrainian LEGO Nationals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following that, in high school I chose to focus my learning on the formal sciences and was rewarded. It was the time of the
                most mind changing experiences and explorations in the fields of mathematics, physics and computer science. Yeah, by the way,
                that Tic-Tac-Toe game was also created around the same time. After competing in various Olympiads and competitions it started
                to become more and more clear what I wanted to dedicate my time to.
            </p>
            <p>
                After graduating highschool in 2018, I found myself studying in the Kitchener-Waterloo area at Conestoga College. During this time I
                started to understand how I can apply all of my coding skills in real-life projects. Taking part in various hackathons and tech 
                events gave me the opportunity to expand my toolset, but more importantly it allowed me to establish connections with like-minded 
                people who would help me excel in my career.
            </p>
            <p>
                College experience and connections led me to join <a href="https://vehikl.com/">Vehikl</a> - a software consultancy based in Waterloo.
                First as a co-op and later as a full-time employee I was finally able to write code that real people would use every day!
