        This project was born when I was solving an interesting 
        <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/traveling-santa-2018-prime-paths" target="_blank">challenge on Kaggle</a>. 
        The challenge was to build a shortest path through a set of points (also called a Travelling Salesman Problem), 
        but with a slight twist: if the index of a point in the sequence is a prime number, 
        then the distance to it from the previous point increases by 10%.

        The TSP problem got me interested and I decided to code a solution from scratch using different algorithms (despite tons
        of existing solutions) to better understand the problem and to practice developing a <code>C++</code> library.
