    <p>This project was born when I was solving an interesting challenge on Kaggle. The challenge was to build a shortest path
    through a set of points (or Travelling Salesman Problem), but with a slight twist: if the index of a point in the
    sequence is a prime number, then the distance to it from the previous one increases by 10%.</p>

    <p>The TSP problem got me interested and I decided to code a solution from scratch using different algorithms (despite tons
    of existing solutions) to better understand the problem and to practice developing a C++ library.</p>
