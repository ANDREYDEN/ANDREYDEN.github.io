    This is a small project inspired by one of Google's <a href="https://www.google.com/doodles/fahrelnissa-zeids-118th-birthday">doodles</a>. 
    Logeomio is a tool for representing words (logos) as a collection of geometrical figures.

<p>
    Each time a logo is generated, the canvas is split into thousands of different polygons (shards). 
    After that each shard is filled either black or white depending on whether it contains a letter or not.
