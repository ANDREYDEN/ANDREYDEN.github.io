<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>
    Foodizzy is a mobile app that combines a simple shopping list with a food storage system which allows users to quickly check what they already have in their fridge when searching for new ingredients. 
    Users can add new items to their shopping/storage lists, move them around or mark them as consumed/wasted. 
    The app also tracks statistics about food consumtion to give insight into different kinds of foods being used and/or thrown away.
